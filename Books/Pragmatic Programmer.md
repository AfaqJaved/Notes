- Its is your life change it the way you like
- The cat ate my source code - lame excuse | take responsibility
- Provide options don't make lame excuse
- Don't live with broken windows - fix it as soon as possible otherwise you will lose the will to fight entropy (change).
- Soup Story - Moral It’s time to bring out the stones. Work out what you can reasonably ask for. Develop it well. Once you’ve got it, show people, and let them marvel. Then say “of course, it would be better if we added...’’ Pretend it’s not important. Sit back and wait for them to start asking you to add the functionality you originally wanted. People find it easier to join an ongoing success. Show them a glimpse of the future and you’ll get them to rally around
- Be the catalyst for change
- Remember the big picture - Frog and boiling water example - Look around for what is changing not just what you are doing personally.
- Japanese ics orders | in software perfection does not exsist.
- Remember what the end users want.
- If you give your users something to play with early, their feedback will often lead you to a better eventual solution
- Know when to stop don't over paint the painting
- Critically analyze what you are reading.
- Communicate effectively
- ETC (easier to change)
- You may need to spend a week or so deliberately asking yourself “did the thing I just did make the overall system easier or harder to change?” Do it when you save a file. Do it when you write a test. Do it when you fix a bug.


## Invest in yourself

### Invest Regularly
Just as in financial investing, you must invest in your knowledge portfolio regularly, even if it’s just a small amount. The habit is as important as the sums, so plan to use a consistent time and place, away from interruptions. A few sample goals are listed in the next section.

### Diversify  
The more different things you know, the more valuable you are. As a baseline, you need to know the ins and outs of the particular technology you are working with currently. But don’t stop there. The face of computing changes rapidly—hot technology today may well be close to useless (or at least not in demand) tomorrow. The more technologies you are comfortable with, the better you will be able to adjust to change. And don’t forget all the other skills you need, including those in non- technical areas.

### Manage risk
Technology exists along a spectrum from risky, potentially high-reward to low-risk, low-reward standards. It’s not a good idea to invest all of your money in high-risk stocks that might collapse suddenly, nor should you invest all of it conservatively and miss out on possible opportunities. Don’t put all your technical eggs in one basket.

### Buy low, sell high
Learning an emerging technology before it becomes popular can be just as hard as finding an undervalued stock, but the payoff can be just as rewarding. Learning Java back when it was first introduced and unknown may have been risky at the time, but it paid off handsomely for the early adopters when it became an industry mainstay later.

### Review and rebalance
This is a very dynamic industry. That hot technology you started investigating last month might be stone cold by now. Maybe you need to brush up on that database technology that you haven’t used in a while. Or perhaps
you could be better positioned for that new job opening if you tried out that other language....
